# DentFlow - Dental Clinic Service System

Our Dental Clinic service system is an advanced tool for managing clinical and administrative processes in a dental practice. It allows you to effectively plan visits, manage patient history, as well as manage staff and resources.

Functions:
1. **Visit Scheduling**: Intuitive interface to easily arrange, view and modify appointments.
2. **Patient Management**: Store and view detailed patient data, including their medical and dental history.
3. **Personnel Management**: Monitor staff schedules, attendance, payroll and contact details.
4. **Resource management**: Track the use and availability of resources such as equipment, materials and medications.

The Dental Clinic Service System is an open-source project. We invite everyone who wants to contribute to the development of this tool to cooperate.

## How it's working?

1. Log in to the system with your username and password.
2. Select the function you are interested in from the main menu: Visit Scheduling, Patient Management, Personnel Management or Resource Management.
3. In each module, you can add, view, edit or delete relevant records.
4. Remember to regularly update the data so that the system can effectively support the management of the clinic.

DentFlow helps to maintain the smoothness and efficiency of your dental practice.
